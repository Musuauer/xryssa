  The starting point for the performance was the popular song "Menussis", which
  many children in Greece learn and dance to at community festivals. It is about
  the man Menussis, who cries because he killed his wife in alcohol intoxication
  because she is said to have talked to another. The name of the woman is
  unknown - only Menussis is named and regretted. The murderous content of the
  song is still today a completely unquestioned part of the cultural heritage of
  Greek children. During my research, I found many songs with similar content,
  also popular in Germany. I finally developed the performance based on the song
  "My Delilah" by Tom Jones (1968), written in English. In the song, the singer
  stabs his wife Delilah to death because she had cheated on him with another
  man. In the performance, a group of young people interprets the lyrics of the
  song, transforms them in part, and opens up a new and liberating view of the
  narrative of the song, which is still powerful in this country and which bears
  witness to heteronormative claims to power and ownership as well as
  subliminally to misogynous ideas.
