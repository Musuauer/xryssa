description: "I was invited to create a performance in a bar in Berlin. I asked three friends of mine to participate in a storytelling quest with one instruction: they had to approach the bar’s guests and convince them to kill someone in the bar that night. Afterwards, the guests' murder stories were to be told to me while we celebrated with a toast. The only aim was that each murder story had to finish with the sentence: “ … and nobody saw me”."
