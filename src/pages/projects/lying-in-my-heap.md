description: "At different locations in and around the Numismatic Museum in Athens, a small group of performers divided into three different groups attempted to communicate by working within and around a codified vocabulary. Each group had different instructions and locations to perform at. The first group was located inside the museum and performed vocal exercises, as well as movements borrowed from the museum guardians. The second group, set up in the yard, tried to create sounds with coins they had in their pockets. The third group consisted of a single person located at the building opposite the museum. This person could move around but was not allowed to enter the museum. The performance lasted four hours and featured material from the unfinished short story “The Burrow” („Der Bau” in German) by Franz Kafka and my brother’s imagined trip to Athens."
performers: "Eva Kehagia, Apostolos Kitsos, Vicky Kyriakoulakou, Aristidis Kallergis, Christiana Ladopoulou, Stratos Menoutis, Mirto Pagkalos, Maria Chatzi"
