media: Performance
year: '2016'
location: 'Numismatic Museum, TWISTING C(R)ASH, Athens'
duration: 240 min
description: >-
  At different locations in and around the Numismatic Museum in Athens, a small
  group of performers divided into three different groups attempted to
  communicate by working within and around a codified vocabulary. Each group had
  different instructions and locations to perform at. The first group was
  located inside the museum and performed vocal exercises, as well as movements
  borrowed from the museum guardians. The second group, set up in the yard,
  tried to create sounds with coins they had in their pockets. The third group
  consisted of a single person located at the building opposite the museum. This
  person could move around but was not allowed to enter the museum. The
  performance lasted four hours and featured material from the unfinished short
  story “The Burrow” („Der Bau” in German) by Franz Kafka and my brother’s
  imagined trip to Athens.
performers: >-
  Eva Kehagia, Apostolos Kitsos, Vicky Kyriakoulakou, Aristidis Kallergis,
