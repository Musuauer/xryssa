  But For Today I Am thematises realities beyond social conventions with the
  adaptation of a song by Antony and the Johnsons. For the performance, I
  invited the Polizeichor Berlin and the Seniorenchor Steglitz to sing a song
  about the feelings of a boy who will be a beautiful woman when he grows up.
  The song was performed by the two groups in a public space at two locations,
  whereby the viewers were free to move between the stations.
