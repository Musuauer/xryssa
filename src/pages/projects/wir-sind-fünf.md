  The performance “Wir Sind Fünf” (‘We Are Five’) is based on the text
  ‘Gemeinschaft’ (‘Community’) by the writer Franz Kafka:

  ‘We are five friends, we once came out of a house one after the other […] Since then we have lived together, it would be a peaceful life if a sixth one didn’t keep interfering […]. He doesn’t do anything to us […]. We don’t know him and don’t want to take him in. The five of us didn’t know each other before, and if you like, we don’t know each other now either, but what is possible and tolerated with the five of us is not possible with the sixth […]. Besides, we are five and we don’t want to be six. […] But no matter how much we push him away, he will come back.’ (Franz Kafka – Gemeinschaft)

  The Six people move, stand still, speak a sentence, sometimes remain silent and change their position. They repeat themselves – sometimes thoughtfully, sometimes angrily. In this way, the group slowly becomes a time-shifted choir, which speaks of five, although six are present.
