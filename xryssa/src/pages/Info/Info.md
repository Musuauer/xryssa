My work is based on speech performances and testimonial actions. It promotes the concept of intimacy with the audience where the body of the artist and those of the participants/collaborators are the subject and, simultaneously, the transmitting mechanism of the work.

      I borrow terms and practices from theatre and conceptual art to turn directing into a set of simple instructions. I invite people to follow them, thus contributing, inevitably, to the final outcome. What interests me is the deviation that takes place in the course of every work and the collective aspect of the creative experience. I endeavor for my work to have a dual status: to remain an event within the real world and, simultaneously, to create a new picture about it. To communicate the paradoxes that inhere, repressed, in daily life and to motivate experiences of pleasure, prompting the question of to what extent are we able to imagine the world and our relationships anew. Apart from participants and viewers, third terms are oftentimes employed, such as objects and photographs.
