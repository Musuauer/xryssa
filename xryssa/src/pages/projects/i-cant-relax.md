description: "The idea for this project emerged from a series of discussions and meetings with the former director of the radio station from the DDR, who formerly worked in the Funkhaus Nalepastraße where the exhibition took place. We talked about the social organisation and the activities of the workers at that time in the building, as well as current events. I invited people applying for asylum and local fishermen to fish freely in the river in front of the large, impressive building. After the event, the fishing rods from the local fishermen along with the improvised ones from the asylum seekers were placed together as an installation inside the building for the remainder of the exhibition."
