description: "The idea of this project is based on the book Kafka – Toward a Minor Literature by Deleuze / Guattari. Central to the project is the character Josephine from Franz Kafka's last short story “Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk”. I invited a Greek woman, who lives in Berlin and does not speak German, to read excerpts from the story in German in a admiring  tone, referencing Josephine. Based on her voice recording, a musical score dealing with language and with suspension and restoration of meaning was created in collaboration with composer Milos Tadic. The work also consists of a video of the performance rehearsals while three figures (performers) attempt to create a portrait of Josephine and call on the audience to participate. The project was complemented by another performance that took place outside the gallery space, wherein a singer tried to vocally interpret phrases of the song “The Impossible Dream”."
