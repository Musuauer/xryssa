description: "I invited twenty Athenians to accompany me singing in a street “happening” on the sidewalk joining Academias and Panepistimiou streets. Positioning ourselves amidst of pedestrians, we sang for two hours with periodic intervals of silence, using the title of the work and three short phrases in the first person: “20 People and One Lesbian. A Public Opera. This is your relationship. I am everywhere and nowhere. You can find me.” During the pauses in the singing, there was just a slight indication that the singers were part of a group, each one of them wore a discrete pin on their clothes. This was the first time these people sang in public. I chose to amplify their public exposure by regular interruptions of the choir. Their dispersal into the crowd during the pauses and the underscoring of each person’s gender."
