duration: "55 min"
description: "The action took place in the city of Nafpaktos. The organisers of the international symposium on the performing arts “Communication of Crisis” invited me to devise a happening with the participation of local adolescents. After six days of workshops, the group went on an excursion through sites with which each participant had personally bonded in the past. It was a silent touring of locales, where the reason for choosing each one and its connection to every young person, remained undisclosed to the group as a whole. The work, comprised of a collection of unsaid stories, took on the form of a common secret, impossible to convey except collectively."
performers: "Zoe Kaokoyiani, Vicky Kalinikou, Georgia Kapodistria, Thomas Karnachoritis, Vagelis Lalopoulos, Dimitris Lionas, Adriana Nikopoulou, Dimitra Nikopoulou, Nikos Nikitaedis, Nikos Panayiotou, Antonis Papadoulas, Spiros Chamilos, Sabrina Chorafa"
